# Decoding a Message from a Text File

This code sample reflects my commitment to **best practices**,
emphasizing **clean** and **maintainable** code.
Additionally, it showcases my proficiency in working with **files** and **data structures**,
alongside my skill in creating thorough and effective **documentation**.

## Challenge

Read an encoded message from a .txt file and return its decoded version as a string.
The input file contains lines with a number followed by a word.
The function decodes the message by arranging numbers in an ascending pyramid structure,
where each row contains one more number than the row above it.
The words corresponding to the numbers at the end of each pyramid row form the decoded message.

## Solution

The *decode_message* function efficiently addresses the challenge
by leveraging smaller, specialized functions:

- *get_message_map*: Extracts a dictionary from the text file where
  each numeric key corresponds to its associated word.

- *get_pyramid_last_elements*: Computes the last element of each row in the pyramid structure by
  iteratively adding the row number to the last element of the previous row until
  reaching the total number of elements.

- *get_decoded_message*: Translates encoded keys into their corresponding decoded values using
  the decoding map, returning a string with the decoded values separated by spaces.

  #### Example Usage
  ```python
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      message_file_path = 'message_map.txt'
      decoded_message = decode_message(message_file_path)
      print(decoded_message)
  ```

  #### Note
  This code expects the text file to adhere to the prescribed format and
  assumes the provided number of elements can construct a complete pyramid.

  ### Code Quality
  This code prioritizes **readability**, **maintainability**, **reusability**, and **testability** principles in its
  design.
  It ensures that the solution not only addresses the immediate challenge effectively
  but also remains **adaptable** and **scalable** for future needs.

  ### Type Safety
  Utilizing *TypeVar* ensures **type safety** and **flexibility** within the code,
  making it adaptable for various input types while maintaining robustness.

  ### Documentation
  Each function is well-documented with clear and concise **docstrings**,
  following **best practices** to ensure the code is **easy to understand**, **maintain**, and **extend**.

I welcome any questions or feedback you may have on the code.
Your insights are invaluable, and I appreciate your time reviewing my work.
