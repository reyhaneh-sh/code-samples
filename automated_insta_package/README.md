# Automated-Insta Python Package

These **three files** are part of a **real project**,
and I have maintained their **original structures** for your review.  

- **automated_insta/auth/[*login.py*](https://github.com/reyhaneh-sh/code-samples/blob/main/automated_insta_package/automated_insta/auth/login.py)**  
  This file is a **key component** of the project,
  showcasing my approach to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and
  my commitment to producing **clean** and **maintainable** code.

- **automated_insta/utils/[*decorators.py*](https://github.com/reyhaneh-sh/code-samples/blob/main/automated_insta_package/automated_insta/utils/decorators.py)**  
  This file demonstrates my skills in applying **design patterns** and
  working with **system commands**.  

- **automated_insta/tests/test_auth/[*test_login.py*](https://github.com/reyhaneh-sh/code-samples/blob/main/automated_insta_package/automated_insta/tests/test_auth/test_login.py)**  
  This file focuses on **unit testing**, ensuring reliable functionality by applying **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles.

Additionally, I have included the [*README.md*](https://github.com/reyhaneh-sh/code-samples/blob/main/automated_insta_package/automated_insta/README.md) file,
which is part of the original project's README file.
It provides a **concise explanation** of the project,
emphasizing my commitment to thorough **documentation**.

I welcome any questions or feedback you may have on the code.
Your insights are invaluable, and I appreciate your time reviewing my work.
